# Jekyll Site

Inspired by Octopress - this is a Jekyll framework, but directed more at website content than blogging.

## Quick start

Assuming you at least have Ruby `1.9.3` installed on your system; You can start building your own website using this framework by:

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/supporttime/jekyll-site my-site`.
* Browse in to the directory `cd jekyll-site`.
* Install all the dependant packages `bundle install`.
* Run the jekyll server `bundle exec jekyll server --watch`.

Your skeleton site should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, This project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
